# Unobtrusive Measurement of Gait Parameters Using Seismographs: An Observational Study

This is the repository of the source code associated with research article "Unobtrusive Measurement of Gait Parameters Using Seismographs: An Observational Study".

This repository contains the code of the proposed step-event extraction algorithm and the gait computation on a real dataset - this participant has explicitly agreed to publish its data (the pp64 Parquet files). Furthermore, the measured and computed gait parameters of all participants are uploaded in the file [statistics.csv](statistics.csv). All results presented in the paper can be regenerated by using the jupyter notebook [paper-code.ipynb](paper-code.ipynb).

## Data Acquisition

+ Run the SRS software: https://gitlab.com/simplay/srs-project
+ Integrate seismographs (e.g., https://raspberryshake.org/) by using the following producer code: https://github.com/simplay/seismograph_server/tree/master
## Requirements

+ Python Interpreter: Python 3.9.15 (e.g., via conda `conda create -n py3915 python=3.9.15`
+ Packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
